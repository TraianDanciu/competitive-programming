# My competitive programming repo

Hello! I am Traian Danciu and in this repo I will store:

- my solutions for some competitive programming problems (in C++ or other languages)
- for some problems, an editorial (which may or may not be written by me)
- my template code for some competitive programming algorithms
- some other projects related to competitive programming
